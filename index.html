        Enger later joined and they released a second demo, Black Is Beautiful which featured many guest musicians. The band then decided to go from death to black metal, recruited Dag Nilsen and changed their name to Darkthrone taking inspiration from
        a Celtic Frost song. The four then recorded another demo called Land of Frost.
